I must go out and leave you here.<br>
But mind now, Conrad, what I say,<br>
Don't suck your thumb while I'm away.<br>
The great tall tailor always comes<br>
<img class="thumbsucker" src="thumbsucker.gif"/>
To little boys who suck their thumbs;<br>
And ere they dream what he's about,<br>
He takes his great sharp scissors out,<br>
And cuts their thumbs clean off and then,<br>
You know, they never grow again."</i></div>

The great, long, red-legged scissor-man.<br>
Oh! children, see! the tailor's come<br>
And caught out little Suck-a-Thumb.<br>
Snip! Snap! Snip! the scissors go;<br>
And Conrad cries out <br>

And looks quite sad, and shows his hands;<br><br>
